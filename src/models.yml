tables:
  # We have a single DynamoDB Table named "Library".
  Library:

    # Let's add two models to our Library table: Author and Book.
    models:
      Author:
        id: string
        firstName: string
        lastName: string
        createdAt: number

      Book:
        id: string
        title: string
        createdAt: number
        author: string

    # Now, imagine we want to be able to retrieve an Author + all their Books
    # in a single DynamoDB Query operation.

    # To do that, we need a specific Author and all their Books to live under the same partition key.
    # How about we use "Author-$id" as the partition key? Great, let's go with that.

    # Beyonce calls a group of models that share the same partition key a "patition".
    # Let's define one now, and name it "Authors"
    partitions:
      Authors:

        # All Beyonce partition keys are prefixed (to help you avoid collisions)
        # We said above we want our final partition key to be "Author-$id",
        # so we set: "Author" as our prefix here
        partitionKeyPrefix: Author

        # And, now we can put a given Author and all their Books into the same partition
        models:
          Author:
            partitionKey: [$id] # "Author-$id"
            sortKey: [Author, $id]

          Book:
            partitionKey: [$author] # "Author-$authorId"
            sortKey: [Book, $id]
